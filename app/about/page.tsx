 <p>        PRANO is perfect imperfection.
It&apos;s a space where traditional jewelry techniques meet contemporary forms – where every piece tells a story not just about metal or stone, but about you.
</p>
<p>
PRANO is creation through attentiveness. Each piece is born from a conscious approach to materials and process: I work with recycled silver and gold, carefully select responsibly sourced stones, avoid excess, and strive for lasting beauty rather than fleeting trends.

In a chaotic world, PRANO seeks to create stillness. Not through loud slogans, but through details, textures, sensations – elements that speak without words. Here, jewelry becomes a talisman, a small sculpture, an architecture of the body.
</p>
<p>
A large part of my time and energy goes into custom orders. Whether it&apos;s a minimal everyday ring or a one-of-a-kind engagement piece filled with meaning and intention – every project matters deeply to me. I believe that jewelry should reflect a person&apos;s story, which is why each custom order becomes a shared creative process between me and the client.
</p>
<p>
To me, jewelry is more than an accessory. It&apos;s a reflection of the inner world, a symbol of values, a quiet statement. Each piece is an invitation to pause, to feel, to hear yourself – just as you are.

Behind the name PRANO is me – Pranas Gurevičius, a jeweler whose journey began back in school. My first jewelry collection became not only a graduation project but also the starting point of my creative path, which I continued at Kaunas School of Applied Arts.
In the summer of 2024, I completed an internship at M.C. Jewellery in Limassol, Cyprus, where I studied various branches of jewelry craft under the guidance of professionals. One of my dearest creations – the necklace “THE TRIP OF AMBER” – received the Audience Award at the international Amber Trip exhibition in 2025. That was one of the first moments I felt that my work spoke not only to me, but to others as well.
</p>
<p>
I believe jewelry doesn&apos;t have to be perfect – it has to be alive. Just like us.
